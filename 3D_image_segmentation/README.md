## 3D Image Segmentation

3D image segmentation task based on the BraTS-2018 dataset. 

The BraTS-2018 dataset utilizes multi-institutional pre-operative MRI scans and focuses on the segmentation of intrinsically heterogeneous (in appearance, shape, and histology) brain tumors, namely gliomas. Furthemore, to pinpoint the clinical relevance of this segmentation task

The sub-regions considered for evaluation are: 1) the "enhancing tumor" (ET),

2) the "tumor core" (TC), and

3) the "whole tumor" (WT)

The labels in the provided data are:

  1: for NCR & NET
  2: for ED
  4: for ET, and
  0: for everything else
